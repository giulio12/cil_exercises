\section{Problem 1}
\subsection{1}
The size is $AA^T\in\mathbb N^{6x6}$ and this matrix suggest us the similarities between movies,
in fact we are multiplying by rows.

\subsection{2}
The size is $A^TA\in\mathbb N^{5x5}$ and this matrix suggest us the similarities between users and their preferences.
In fact we are multiplying by columns.

\subsection{3}
$$A = UDV^T$$
$$A\in\mathbb N^{5x6}, U\in\mathbb N^{6x6}, D\in\mathbb N^{6x5}, V^T\in\mathbb N^{5x6}$$

\subsection{4}
By adding some noise as values ($5.5$) we want to find the underlying structure in order to predict the mssing
values. In addition we find the correlation between users and concepts (i.e.: genre of the movie), and between
movies and concepts.

\subsection{5}
Columns $1-3$ are the more reasonable to keep, since their values is higher also the affecting factor is higher.

\subsection{6}
Matrix $U$ maps movies-to-concepts.

\subsection{7}
Matrix $V$ maps users-to-concepts.

\subsection{8+9}
Solution on the sheet.

\subsection{10}
$29.7$ is the strength of comedies.\\
$10.00$ is the strength of action movies.\\
$7.09$ is the strength of sci-fi movies.

\subsection{11}
$$A_3 = U_3D_3V^T_3$$
$$U[:,1:3]D[1:3, 1:3]V[:,1:3]^T$$

\subsection{12}
Error under euclidian norm: 
$$\|A - A_3\|_2 = 2.7599$$
Error under Frobenius norm:
$$\|A - A_3\|_2^F = 2.8415$$

\subsection{13}
\subsubsection{a.}
$$A = UDV^T$$
$$V^T = D^{-1}U^TA$$
$$[-0.46 0.35]^T$$
\subsubsection{b.}
The genres that Bob may like are action movies and sci-fi movies.
\subsection{14}
Bob's rating does not affect our prediction system.
